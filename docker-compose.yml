      # WARNING!
      # We need to map the Docker socket to the HOST operating system's Docker socket to make sure
      # Docker commands are passed into the host operating system, and not kept within the Docker container itself.
      # This is what allows us to start Docker containers in the host OS from within the Docker container itself.
      # This implies the Docker container is NOT isolated, since all Docker commands are passed into the HOST OS.
      # If this is a problem for your particular needs, please remove the next line of code!
